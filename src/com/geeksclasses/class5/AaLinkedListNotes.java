/**
 * Linked List Types :
 * 
 * 1. Singly
 *  
 * 2. Doubly
 * 	We can insert before also in O(1)
 *  Delete from end also in O(1)
 * 
 * 3. Circular
 * 	We can insert at the beggining and end in O(1) time without maintaining extra pointer
 *  and without maintaining previous pointer i.e. even with singly circular linked list
 * 
 * Best Use Case :
 * When used for polynomials, multiplying huge numbers, because we don't need random access.
 * 
 * Round Robin Scheduling in OS - We use circular linked list.
